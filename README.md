# nfl-statgraph

# Overview
In this project, I made a Python script that web scrapes NFL team and player stats from ESPN.com, then used matplotlib to visualize the data.
For example, you can see the top *n* players based on position for that season by using simple bar charts.

**Due to HTML changes on ESPN.com, the script is no longer able to complete the scrape. Anticipating this eventuality, I saved all the data in a pickle file.**

Technologies used:
* Python
* bs4 (beautiful soup)
* matplotlib
* seaborn
